# Next.js Best Practices

## Sensitive Files

DO NOT read or modify:

- .env files
- **/config/secrets.*
- **/*.pem
- Any file containing API keys, tokens, or credentials

## Security Practices

- Never commit sensitive files
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Keep credentials out of logs and output

## Git Repository Manager

- Use conventional commit, add footer for every commit "Signed-off-by: RooCode"
- Remember **DONT** write in 'main' branch, write code in 'dev' branch or create new branch if need
- Use rebase for merge branch

## Manager Package

- Use pnpm instead of npm
- shadcn-ui is old name of lib, use shadcn instead of

## Component Organization

- Client components must use [name].client.tsx naming format
- Components should be less than 300 lines
- Break down large components into smaller, focused ones
- Use subcomponents for complex UIs
- Group related components in feature folders

## Workflow

- When create a new api route, remember create swagger api document
- When create new UI component, priority to use shadcn@latest before create new component

## Project Structure

- Use the App Router directory structure
- Place components in `app` directory for route-specific components
- Place shared components in `components` directory
- Place utilities and helpers in `lib` directory
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`)

## Components

- Use Server Components by default
- Mark client components explicitly with 'use client'
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Place static content and interfaces at file end

## Performance

- Optimize images: Use WebP format, size data, lazy loading
- Minimize use of 'useEffect' and 'setState'
- Favor Server Components (RSC) where possible
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Data Fetching

- Use Server Components for data fetching when possible
- Implement proper error handling for data fetching
- Use appropriate caching strategies
- Handle loading and error states appropriately

## Routing

- Use the App Router conventions
- Implement proper loading and error states for routes
- Use dynamic routes appropriately
- Handle parallel routes when needed

## Forms and Validation

- Use Zod for form validation
- Implement proper server-side validation
- Handle form errors appropriately
- Show loading states during form submission

## State Management

- Minimize client-side state
- Use React Context sparingly
- Prefer server state when possible
- Implement proper loading states
